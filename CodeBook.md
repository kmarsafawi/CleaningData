## "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" Codebook

### Description
The file "tidy_data.txt" has 180 rows and 68 variables. Each row identifies the subject and the activity the subject performed while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the researchers captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity.

R Script merges the observations researchers derived for subjects that had been separated into "test" and "training" groups.
It adds the variables for subject and activity to that combined file as the original dataset kept these as separate files.

The file "tidy_data.txt" contains the average of all dataset observations for that subject and activity over the mean and standard deviation of the variables the researchers estimated from their measurements. This does not include the "meanFreq" weighted average of the frequency components that is included in the original dataset.

## Subject and Activity Identifiers

### subjectid
Identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

### activity
Identifies the activity performed by the subject. There are six values for each subject:

* walking - Walking
* walkingupstairs - Walking upstairs
* walkingdownstairs - Walking downstairs
* sitting - Sitting
* standing - Standing
* laying- Laying
